This project explores the use of a large language model (LLM), specifically GPT-4o-mini, to coordinate complex robotic behavior sequences for cooking a variety of dishes. The system employs a robotic arm executing hardcoded behavioral functions, while the LLM manages high-level decision-making and sequencing, allowing for flexible and adaptive meal preparation. By leveraging natural language processing to interpret and execute cooking tasks dynamically, this approach demonstrates a novel paradigm for robotic automation that prioritizes adaptability and efficiency over rigid, preprogrammed workflows.
